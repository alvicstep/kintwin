# KinTwin
KinTwin is a fork of [KinBP](https://github.com/DmNosachev/KinBP). It is a drop-in replacement of a controller and thumb cluster PCB boards for [Kinesis Contoured keyboards](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Kinesis_Contoured).

It serves the same purpose as [KinT controller](https://github.com/kinx-project/kint) created by Michael Stapelberg.

## Comparison with KinT and KinBP
- The controller board is a simplified version on KinBP board. It uses **WeAct Studio STM32F401** development board. KinT controller uses Teensy board. The price difference makes it very hard to justify the usage of Teensy development board these days
- KinTwin controller board uses only FPC connectors to interface with other PCB boards. In that regard it has the same design as stock Kinesis Advantage II
- KinTwin controller does not support soldered connectors between the controller board and thumb cluster boards
- Similar to KinBP repo, KinTwin includes PCB boards for thumb clusters. They are functionally identical to stock Kinesis Advantage II. Unlike KinBP, these PCBs are not reversible (hence there are 2 of them). Also, similar to stock boards, they use through-hole diodes and FPC connectors
- Controller board was originally designed in KiCad by [DmNosachev](https://github.com/DmNosachev). KinTwin is a cloned and simplified version of the original design and as such it also uses KiCad
- Thumb cluster boards were designed in [Sprint Layout 6.0](https://www.electronic-software-shop.com/lng/en/electronic-software/sprint-layout-60.html?language=en)


## Controller compatibility with top row PCBs, keywell PCBs and thumb cluster PCBs

|Keyboard Model                             |Top row PCBs|Keywell PCBs|Thumb cluster PCBs|
|-------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------------|
|KB600 (Advantage2)                         |Yes         |Yes         |Yes               |
|KB500 (Advantage)                          |Yes         |Yes         |No                |
|KB13x (Essential, Classic, Professional) * |Yes         |Yes         |No                |
|100/110/120 **                             |No          |No          |No                |

\* These keyboards require custom thumb cluster PCBs which are provided in the repo\
** You are likely not going to find these keyboards in the wild. They are 20+ years old
